# RGViperChat
An iOS chat app written following a VIPER architecture and BDD

With this project I'd like to gather all the best practices I can find when working with a VIPER architecture and a BDD approach. ***VIPER is the Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture implementation, and it pushes the SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) to the limit***. Although it works seamlessly on linear and simple apps, there are always cases in which VIPER doesn't fit perfectly without thinking a bit further: inter module communications, or working view containers like UIPageViewControllers, UITabBarControllers, or Burger menus. The dependency injection is another challenge, particularly for those cases in which a service is reused across different modules of the app.

Here you can find a presentation of a talk I gave about VIPER and BDD: https://robertogarrido.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Clean-Architectures-and-BDD-on-iOS-GitHub.pdf
